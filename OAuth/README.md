# Introduction 
This is a demo application demonstrating how to make a connection to IoL via OAuth.

You can find further doumentation about how to do this in the [developer documentation](https://developer.logtrade.info/logtrade-iol-core-programmers-guide/connecting-applications/).

The code that performs the connection is in `Logtrade.Iol.Examples.Core` while the `Logtrade.Iol.Examples.OAuth.Web` project shows it in action.

If you wish to get the web projhect running you will need to use ngrok as a reverse proxy for your localhost, or something similar.

The first time running the web project will give you instructions on how to set up an application in your IoL account in order to test the process.
